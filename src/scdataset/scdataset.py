    """
    Iterable PyTorch Dataset for on-disk data collections with flexible sampling strategies.

    This dataset implementation provides efficient iteration over large on-disk
    data collections using configurable sampling strategies. It supports various
    data transformations, custom fetch/batch callbacks, and automatic handling
    of multiprocessing workers.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data_collection : object
        The data collection to sample from (e.g., AnnCollection, HuggingFace Dataset,
        numpy array, etc.). Must support indexing (``__getitem__``) and length
        (``__len__``) operations.
    strategy : SamplingStrategy
        Strategy for sampling indices from the data collection. Determines the
        order and selection of samples.
    batch_size : int
        Number of samples per minibatch. Must be positive.
    fetch_factor : int, default=1
        Multiplier for fetch size relative to batch size. Higher values may
        improve I/O efficiency by fetching more data at once.
    drop_last : bool, default=False
        Whether to drop the last incomplete batch if it contains fewer than
        ``batch_size`` samples.
    fetch_transform : Callable, optional
        Function to transform data after fetching but before batching.
        Applied to the entire fetch (multiple batches worth of data).
    batch_transform : Callable, optional
        Function to transform each individual batch before yielding.
    fetch_callback : Callable, optional
        Custom function to fetch data given indices. Should accept
        ``(data_collection, indices)`` and return the fetched data.
        If None, uses default indexing (``data_collection[indices]``).
    batch_callback : Callable, optional
        Custom function to extract batch data from fetched data.
        Should accept ``(fetched_data, batch_indices)`` and return the batch.
        If None, uses default indexing (``fetched_data[batch_indices]``).

    Attributes
    ----------
    collection : object
        The underlying data collection.
    strategy : SamplingStrategy
        The sampling strategy being used.
    batch_size : int
        Size of each batch.
    fetch_factor : int
        Fetch size multiplier.
    drop_last : bool
        Whether incomplete batches are dropped.
    fetch_size : int
        Total number of samples fetched at once (batch_size * fetch_factor).
    sort_before_fetch : bool
        Always True. Indices are sorted before fetching for optimal I/O.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If batch_size or fetch_factor is not positive.
    TypeError
        If data_collection doesn't support required operations or strategy
        is not a SamplingStrategy instance.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from scdataset import scDataset
    >>> from scdataset.strategy import Streaming
    >>> import numpy as np
    
    >>> # Simple streaming dataset
    >>> data = np.random.randn(1000, 50)  # 1000 samples, 50 features
    >>> strategy = Streaming()
    >>> dataset = scDataset(data, strategy, batch_size=32)
    >>> len(dataset)  # Number of batches
    32
    
    >>> # With custom transforms
    >>> def normalize_batch(batch):
    ...     return (batch - batch.mean()) / batch.std()
    >>> dataset = scDataset(
    ...     data, strategy, batch_size=32, 
    ...     batch_transform=normalize_batch
    ... )
    
    >>> # Iterate through batches
    >>> for batch in dataset:
    ...     print(batch.shape)  # (32, 50)
    ...     break

    scdataset.strategy.BlockWeightedSampling : Weighted sampling with blocks
    scdataset.strategy.ClassBalancedSampling : Automatic class balancing

    Notes
    -----
    The dataset automatically handles PyTorch's multiprocessing by distributing
    fetch ranges among workers. Each worker gets a different subset of the data
    to avoid duplication.

    Data is fetched in chunks of size ``batch_size * fetch_factor`` and then
    divided into batches. This can improve I/O efficiency, especially for
    datasets where accessing non-contiguous indices is expensive.

        Notes
        -----        
        The fetch-then-batch approach can improve I/O efficiency by:
        
        - Sorting indices before fetching for better disk access patterns
        - Fetching multiple batches worth of data at once
        - Reducing the number of data access operations
        
        Shuffling behavior is controlled by the sampling strategy's
        ``_shuffle_before_yield`` attribute.
