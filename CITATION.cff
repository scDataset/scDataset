abstract: >-
  Modern single-cell datasets now comprise hundreds of millions of cells, 
  presenting significant challenges for training deep learning models that 
  require shuffled, memory-efficient data loading. While the AnnData format 
  is the community standard for storing single-cell datasets, existing data 
  loading solutions for AnnData are often inadequate: some require loading 
  all data into memory, others convert to dense formats that increase storage 
  demands, and many are hampered by slow random disk access. We present 
  scDataset, a PyTorch IterableDataset that operates directly on one or more 
  AnnData files without the need for format conversion. The core innovation 
  is a combination of block sampling and batched fetching, which together 
  balance randomness and I/O efficiency. On the Tahoe 100M dataset, scDataset 
  achieves up to a 48× speed-up over AnnLoader, a 27× speed-up over HuggingFace 
  Datasets, and an 18× speed-up over BioNeMo in single-core settings. These 
  advances democratize large-scale single-cell model training for the broader 
  research community.
